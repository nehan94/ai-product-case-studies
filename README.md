# AI Product Case Studies (Udacity-inspired, written in my own words)

This repository contains AI product thinking artifacts and case studies based on learnings from the Udacity AI Product Manager Nanodegree.

**Important note:** These documents are **not Udacity templates** and do not include proprietary course content. They are **my own summaries and product thinking write-ups** created to demonstrate how I frame problems, define metrics, evaluate trade-offs, and plan iterations for AI-enabled products.

## How to read these
Each case study follows a consistent structure:

- Data and constraints
- Options considered and trade-offs
- Metrics and success criteria
- Risks (bias, privacy, reliability)
- Iteration and rollout plan
